# Webpack :briefcase:

This plugin demonstrates how webpack can be used to import external packages.

## Usage :clipboard:

- **Step 0:** Before hosting the plugin, you need to build it first.
  - To install the dependencies, run `npm install` on your computer.
  - To build the plugin, run `npm build` on your computer. If all went well, you should see a `dist` folder with the file `WebpackShowcase.min.js` inside.
- **Step 1:** Host the plugin on a [CORS enabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) server, or upload the `dist/WebpackShowcase.min.js` file into your own space
  - If you are hosting the plugin on a server, you need to copy the full URL to the `WebpackShowcase.min.js` file
  - To host the plugin in your own space, you can go to File -> Storage and click the top-right "upload" button
  - Once it has been uploaded, click on the `WebpackShowcase.min.js` file and select "Copy URL"
- **Step 2:** Add the plugin to your space by clicking "Plugins" and scrolling to the bottom to click the "Add from URL" button. Paste the URL to the plugin here.
- **Done!** Now you should see a popup with a unique identifier generated by an external package.
